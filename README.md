We will make a class called *StatTools*
StatTools is *not* going to actually hold data--
we will *not* make objects of the StatTools class.
  **Instead**,
   it will have a number of functions that would be helpful when analyzing numbers.

Stat Tools should have functions that take in an *Arrays or Vectors of long longs*, and return:
Max
Min
Mean
Mode
Median

**Try some graphs:**
Stem-and-Leaf plots
"Bar" chart (use rows of asterisks for bars).
